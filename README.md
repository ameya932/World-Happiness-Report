# world_happiness_report

This data analysis report consists of information from the year 2021, which includes 149 different countries and their respective parameters like GDP per capita, generosity, social support, corruption, freedom to make life choices, etc which are essential factors in finding the happiness of a particular country. 

Firstly, I have prepared and cleaned my data for performing exploratory data analysis(EDA). During the EDA process, I have used various Python libraries like seaborn and matplotlib to plot and understand the correlation between the various parameters of the happiness index. The insights which I gained have been written down at the end of each correlation.

Finally, I have answered a few questions which I had regarding the analysis I performed. The answer to these questions are also duly noted in detail.
